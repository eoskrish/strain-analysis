# strain-analysis

This is the bunch of code written in MATLAB to analyze images and measure the strain from them. 

version 1 (v1) files use the definitions of strain.
version 2 (v2) files use the formula in ref. PhysRevE.57.7192.pdf

get_vertices_manual.m extracts the vertices using uiget command. This requires clicking on the vertices manually.
the x-ccordinates are stored in vertex_xcoords.dat
the y-coordinates are stored in vertex_ycoords.dat
